00:13
Hi David. Hi Robin, you okay? Yes. Sorry for the delay.  Are you available longer or? Yeah, yeah, it's fine. Yeah, no problem. Perfect. Yeah.  I had a little bit of a delay in our routine because in Berlin right now is a lot of snow and ice and  it's ice then there's snow then there's ice. Yeah, it's same  here.

00:42
Yeah, yeah. So I mean, guess anywhere in Europe right now, right? It's much more colder than usual. Oh, yeah, definitely. So you're from  Berlin? Yeah, currently I'm in Berlin, exactly. So we are living now in Berlin. We have been in  Munich before and also Düsseldorf, different areas of Germany.  So which are you from Germany originally? Yeah, exactly. Which part?  Northern Germany. So  Kiel, Hamburg, maybe, you know. Okay, yeah. I lived in Germany for three years.

01:12
Ah nice, where have you lived?  It was a place called Depmold.  Yeah I know actually. Yeah so I was in the British Army.  Ah yeah yeah yeah. yeah Berlin's one of the few places I haven't been to because it was in East Germany when I was in Germany.  Ah yeah.  So quite a while ago yeah. But yeah I was in... oh

01:36
Not last year, the year before, it was in Berchtesgaden. Berchtesgaden? Yeah, down in Bavaria. Ah, okay, yeah. Go near the Austrian border. Yeah, so we had a nice holiday down Let me check where Detmold is because somehow it says something. Detmold is near Paderborn. Paderborn, Bielefeld. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, okay. And maybe I confuse it because I know a couple of those stations, like especially near Aachen, for example. I've lived in Aachen quite a while.

02:06
And there's like the big UN military base, right? So yeah, all of the British army bases have gone now, I believe. I don't think there's any left. Hmm. True. There's to be lots and lots. um My sister-in-law is from Bremen.  So yeah, she, so my brother was in a place called Fallingbostel. Yeah, exactly.  Near Bremen. And so he married a German girl and she moved here.

02:35
Been here oh for 30, 33 years, something like that.  Nice, nice. Yeah. Falling Bostles actually, I have been there a lot in my childhood near there. So I know Germany quite well actually. So yeah, I like Germany. Nice, nice. Yeah. I've been a bit to the UK. I have been to  Northern  England, basically Scotland. Okay. So that was really amazing. I've been to London as well and a little bit around.

03:04
Like there was a one,  like this is big ECMWF center. Maybe you know from  regarding meteorology. Meteorology. Meteorology. It's a hard word. I don't know anymore where exactly it is, but somewhere in the east, uh west  of London. Reading. Yeah. Oh, Reading. Yeah. Reading.  Yeah. Yeah. That was also interesting. There was a hackathon actually.

03:33
And then we have been to Northern Ireland now, two years ago for a wedding. Whereabouts in Northern Ireland? We were in, let me see, Armagh. Yeah, exactly. Oh Armagh, yeah. Yeah, I was stationed in Northern Ireland in 1989, a place called Bally Kelly, but it was when there was a lot of problems in the UK at the time. So, yeah.

04:00
Yeah, that's  crazy, like we hear  some crazy stories. Oh yeah, Northern Ireland. Extreme stories.

04:25
Can you hear me again?

04:56
Okay, now I can see you again, I think.

05:47
Now I can see you again. Yeah, it's my wifi.

05:52
Something  went wrong there. Yeah. Yeah.  It was my internet for some reason.  Yeah. No worries. em Yeah. So, yeah. Also a couple of questions  related to metrology and everything, right? But maybe we first just jump into the coding and  go to those questions  on the site. There will be moments when we wait for something to download. Yeah, of course. Yeah.  So,  yeah.

06:21
Basically, um I used to do often like one hour meetings. So one  meeting per week, rather one hour um to go really deep into different topics.  But now with uh coding with AI,  it could also be that it's not so necessary. So we just start with two times 30 minutes. Yeah, I think that would be good. Yeah. Yeah. And then we can see, right? If we have the feeling it's too shallow, we want to have some more like

06:50
more time together. That's one option. Also, there's  at least one hour,  even a bit more for code review per week. like, like two to three hours is basically the  commitment from the code for me, right from the coach.  And that's something that many people not don't leverage as much as they could. Right. So  I guess now it's also changed a little bit more because with the AI coding, you can get more

07:19
make more and it's tough sometimes to sort out like, uh, can generate a lot of lines of code and it's a lot of garbage. Yeah. Sometimes it's also really just neat. And, yeah. So the idea is that, uh, you just throw as much stuff at me as you can possibly. I mean, it out, but maybe, feel free to rather write too much in the beginning. Yeah. It happens very rarely actually.

07:47
Yeah. That it's too much.  Better asking more than less.  I do tend to generate a lot of questions.  Yeah.  Perfect. Perfect. um Yeah. And then  otherwise  I'm recording the zoom as we have  noticed. Normally I, we can create one GitHub issue where we just put all the links with the password. Okay. And then you can access it whenever you want. All right. I mean, like we say, right, we don't, want to avoid tutorial analysis. So.

08:17
Yeah. Not that, you know, rewatch the same thing 10 times. you understand everything. No, it's about getting coding and so on. Right. But sometimes I think it's really helpful and also for you afterwards.  I like to, in this time that we have together, also shoot out a lot of stuff. Yeah. Without you expecting to,  without expecting you to memorize everything or  take it down. But like this, we have a lot of information in this videos and you can access it also later. That's good. Yeah. Cool.

08:47
Yeah, I guess that some of the setup and then I can share or maybe you can share screen. Have you already gotten the invite, accepted the invite to the repo and to the project? Yes, I've got that.  Perfect. So maybe you can share that and I can maybe also just quick question in the beginning. Do you have experience with using GitHub for project management? Like, no, I'm creating issues,  the Kanban boards and this kind of stuff. No, nothing like that.

09:15
Yeah, so that's something that I do in the beginning.  Let me just quickly check because I sent you already some links. But there may be another one where I actually show how I do.

09:31
No,  think... Ah, no, yeah, I think now I remember this one.

09:45
em because  you can use a lot of stuff there, em but  so  shouldn't lose yourself in it. But if the company uses GitHub, it's nice if you already know a little bit what things you can do, right? Yeah. And the end of the day, for me, it always breaks down to having some kind of board where you use Kanban style or Scrum or something in between like Scrumban, what we like to say. uh

10:12
And  then just  of course maintaining the issues and so on so that you have a board that is somehow reflective of the current state.  Do you already share a screen? I was trying to share it but  it wants to open the system settings. Oh, here we go. Oh yeah, yeah, classic. Can you see Nice, em yeah, now I can see a screen. Yeah, cool.  Perfect.

10:41
So also, um it's always helpful if for this 30-minute session that you prepare this view. And even more important, if you go on the projects page  with a 1 exactly, then you can click on PDM David.  And yeah, this is maybe the most important view that we can start with  because  we will now fill the backlog in this board with issues.

11:11
And in this board, can be either  issues just generally related to PDM. So  maybe set up the board, right? Or em attend five mindset calls, for example. This kind of stuff so that it's not related at all to your  repository, to your code. But  mostly, the issues that will pop up here will be related to your code.

11:39
So then we create the issues in the code repository. And for example, we could create an issue that  says  implement a simplistic airflow deck. Yeah. So very clear,  very narrow, right? Yeah. Very code related. em And that's maybe actually the exact first one that we can create. So you can click here on  Add Item. And then you can click on that plus.

12:03
And say create new issue. Yeah. You need to click on that, I think. Okay.  And.

12:14
I think that's correct. Now let me think for a second actually. Yeah, I think we switched to this there.

12:26
because we used to do it a little bit differently, but we consolidated it a little bit to make it more simplistic. One second.

12:41
Bye bye, it's speedy. Yeah, I also already bookmarked those two links. So basically to the repo and to this project page.  I want to just double check one thing  before I say something wrong. Yeah.

13:01
Did you already create a repo for this project in your own GitHub? No. No, not yet. um

13:12
Yeah, so em basically then let's do that together because I think that's still the better way to do it.  Because this repository that you saw now, em if you go back to the other view, em yeah, this is the project. it's a bit confusing because GitHub calls this project and also the repository sometimes projects. em if you go just back maybe on the tab.

13:39
On the top left in the browser, if you go back, back, backwards. Oh, Exactly this one. So this exactly that's a repository, but from the PDM program perspective, right? So here, if you create, for example, updates in the wins file, then Bob has created some scripts and so on that automatically retrieve it. And he's observing this as well. So he may sometimes ask us to update it.

14:09
Yeah, so this repo really is for the progress for the organization of the program. And then we have another repository for the code where we actually put in the code. We may also add some code here, like maybe snippets or so if it helps. But yeah, the idea is to create like this extra repo because em yeah, here this is maybe something that you want to keep private, right? The wins could be something that is more, maybe you don't want to share publicly or so later, like this whole.

14:37
You didn't win file with all the  history and so on.  But the other repository that you have in your own GitHub, that's something you would want to maybe make public so that you can brag about it.  Okay. um yeah, long story short, you can go to your own  account on the top right and create a repo.

15:03
On the top right, if you click on your  picture there. Yes. then  nice first UV project. sounds good already.  A new project. Oh yeah, I've been messing about for the past few days, so there is some activity.  Yeah, nice.

15:30
And  yeah, you can choose yourself as an owner and we can maybe call it  airflow spark data pipeline.

15:48
Let's see with the... Maybe it will complain about it because it has spaces. So we can maybe just go with dashes right away.  And I'm not sure about lowercase and uppercase. Okay. I'll see what happens.  Yeah, also fine.  I work with the IDE anyway, so I don't mind about the name so much, but people who need to write git clone or git commit uh could be...  Yeah, you're right. I'll do it.

16:20
Airflow dash  or underscore. Yeah.

16:27
Yeah. And then choose an owner would be yourself. I think you maybe can also choose PYBytes,  DJ Bambi, Yeah.  And  yeah, the rest, I think you can put visibility to private if you like.  It's  okay. I don't mind either.  And  no template, nothing. It's fine. You know that, I mean, license of course is relevant at some point, maybe right away. Actually, if you'd put it public, then let's just put MIT license.

16:58
em And then create repository because if it doesn't have a license, people are actually not allowed to use it. uh and then there like the  most important things maybe to know about licenses is there's copyright and copy left. Yeah. Then  if it's copyright, then um you kind of can use it for,  for different purposes as well, but you  need to adhere to the respective license. Okay. It's copy left.

17:26
then you have to make it copy left again, like kind of keep the license.  And then there are some differences about whether you can monetize it or not and these kinds of things. I mean, that's probably best to just prompt or ask when you have a specific use case, right? That you then ask  the AI also which license is best for you. yeah,  I think we have somewhere also an overview of different licenses. Okay, then you can invite me to this one. So, um

17:56
There should be on the settings.  And there's this gear icon. Yeah, exactly.  And collaborators.  And then use passkey, perfect.

18:23
And  yeah, then you can add people type in Z A U B E E R E R. Exactly. That's me.  And  so the name is actually kind of magician, but  my show name is beer as well. So it's kind of a word game.  Okay. In German.  Right. Okay. Zauberer.  Yeah, exactly.

18:53
So does that mean some, is that a German word? that always a play on words? Yeah, Zauberer is a German word, magician, but it's not with two E, it's just with one E. Ah, right. Okay. Okay. Okay. Got the invite. Let me accept it. So, um, sounds like Zauber. Zauber is the clean, isn't it? Yeah, exactly. It sounds similar, but the Z in German is more hard. It's Z, like Zauberer.

19:23
Yes.  Okay, cool. I got it.  So yeah, that means with GitHub itself, how familiar are you?

19:36
GitHub. Yeah, GitHub.  So yeah, just kind of not massive. You know, I've obviously been, you know, I've worked with  Git and kind of cloned repositories and,  you know, changes up to GitHub. But that, when I did the  data engineering  bootcamp two, three years ago, we did a lot of pull requests. Yeah.

20:04
But was three years ago, so I haven't really sort of done much of that since then.  And did you set up GitHub Action  maybe  or like the CI-CD pipeline by yourself?  Yeah, we did. But again, it was three years ago. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So  my goal for the first one, two weeks, let's say, is that we set up  the repository with the code quality checks, with GitHub CI, like GitHub Actions,  with a simple Airflow DAG as well.

20:33
um So that you have like touched all of these points in a very simple way. And then like I said before, we go deeper and deeper. So I already set up, uh so I haven't used Spark much before, like set it up myself yet, but I, in the last days I set it up local and Docker, Docker compose and so on. eh Is that something you have experience with like Docker or Docker? Yeah, I've used Docker, yeah. Yeah, perfect.

20:58
So  it was actually not too much trouble to get it running.  So  just so you know, I also like  worked a bit further ahead already so that I can make sure I can support you with all the different.  So I set Spark  locally without Docker, which was really difficult.  Ah, okay, okay.  But I also use Docker as well to run Spark. yeah. Yeah. And you're using...

21:25
Mac, right? If I saw it right with touch ID. Okay, perfect. That will make things easier. As I saw with Windows, was more of a hassle to... I've got a quick question before we go any further. you said you use... Visual Studio Code? No, in the videos I watched you use... WSL maybe. No, I'm blanking now. Conda.

21:54
Yeah, Konda. Yeah, that's a good point. Yeah. So um I was going to ask sort of why.  Yeah. Yeah.  So that's a very good question, actually. So  I  used Konda before, because in Konda, you can choose which Python version to install. And Konda manages both Python and dependencies. And it also allows you to install PIP dependencies and Konda dependencies, because Konda packaging is  another.

22:23
word, right? Maybe you know about. um So as you want to, example, until now, if you want to do something with GPUs uh for machine learning, for example, and you want to use  TensorFlow and stuff with Nvidia, with CUDA, which  usually if you want to do something with GPUs, then you also want to do something with CUDA because Nvidia is really ahead there.  Then you actually  can make your life really terrible and install it somehow manually.

22:52
Or you make, or you just use Conda.  So I, I set up, so I come from the scientist background as well. Right. So naturally Conda was anyway, a little bit closer, but,  um,  I stick with it because also, for example, I did one project where we,  uh, set up, um,  translation as transcription pipeline exactly with GPU, because with GPU is much faster than the CPU, for example, and stuff like that. So, um, then it came in really handy that, you know, Conda and you can.

23:21
just install it like such. However, Conda is now for sure outdated because  there's a Pixie, which was created by  one uh maintainer, let's say, from Conda, this ecosystem.  So that's P-I-X-I.  And  it's basically Conda and Rust and everything. it's like UV.  It's pretty fast. Yeah, it's like what UV is to pip, uh Pixie is to

23:50
So usually like the last year or two, I always said like, just use Pixie because  with Pixie you get the whole thing, right? You get  Conda, you get PIP.  However, for some reason, UV like  was like adopted really fast. So  if you only want to do  the things that are doable with PIP, which in most cases is sufficient,  then UV is now the standard for sure. em

24:19
And maybe they also were better in really quickly implementing it in a way that it was very supported by VS code,  the public  packages like fast API and so  on  were going for it. yeah,  and I think it's going to be interesting because UV tries to solve some of these core or root causes for why it's  hard to install, for example, CUDA. They try to solve them with a Python community.

24:48
And if they are successful, then it could be that you can do everything in pip and you don't need conda anymore for those things. Yeah. However, pixie is also  interesting if you think about robotics, for example, because  it's not only for Python, but it's also for other languages. So you can manage Rust.  There's something called Ross, which is a, I have never worked with it, but it's for robotics. Basically I have some  podcasts, like episodes actually with  pixie, the pixie founder.

25:18
em So yeah, long story short is now I would recommend UV as a go-to because it's broadly used.  If you are heading into  data science,  GPU world and so on, or if you just want to do something with robotics or with other programming languages as well, then Pixie is probably a good idea to check out. em And yeah, that's pretty much it. I mean, why use poetry or PIP or whatever?

25:46
kind of outdated by now. yeah, UV also allows you to manage Python version, right? I think so that's  really nice if you have something that just manages it completely. Because  I did do poetry with a couple of clients. It's like two, three years back.  And it was always like,  okay, something doesn't work. And I'm like,  well, did you set up the Python  correctly? Right? And they asked me like, what does that mean? And I'm like, ah, yeah. So it's additional frictionless. Yeah.

26:15
I tried a little bit of poetry. uh And then the last thing I did was UV, which you saw.  I quite liked UV. was quite nice. Really fast.  Which is nice. Exactly. Also again, because UV is also in Rust, implemented in Rust. So I would say,  yeah, there's a lot of movement to making the things that are needed for Python available in Rust, because then they're much faster.  And I think this whole...

26:42
support system of the language is really helpful because before linting, the MyPy type checking and so on just takes long time and that adds friction. And if you remove those and yeah, developer speed is much faster right away. So yeah, maybe you can just clone the repository and like show a bit how you use VS code. will add, will show you, I will send you the podcast link about the.

27:10
I have it steady, do I have it?

27:15
Ah, no, I don't have it here. need to update my list.

27:27
Yeah. I mean, if you look at the circle  libraries, the  code clinics, there's a bunch of stuff that I uh edit.  And also podcasts, actually. That's why I didn't have it here. Like there are a couple of podcasts, episodes where I talk with the some creators in the Python world. Great of last fast API, identic, uh uh,  else? Yeah. Basically a couple of more of them. Yeah. Prefect as well.  All right. Nice. I'll watch those.

27:58
Okay. Yeah. I mean, that's your chance now, right? Like if you listen to those episodes again, like don't do it in time when you could code because coding is the most important, but when you're, when you're in transit or whatever, listening to this podcast, and then if you have some questions, can note them down and ask me like you did now, right?  That's exactly what the same time is for.  Perfect. em Yeah. So VS code extensions.  Which extensions do you use so far?

28:29
Uh, so I've got,  um, quite a few, so yeah. Yeah. That looks good. Yeah. For sure. Fine enough. Like for now I saw all the most important ones, I would say. Yeah. Python kind of a lot of stuff in there. I like notebooks, doc, uh, airflow. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, that's good.  Yeah. Yeah. Cool. So, um, yeah, no, that's, that's good because in the beginning I always want to make sure that I have a good.

28:58
overview of how the setup looks like roughly. then  like writing code, going to debugger quickly. Then I see also how you debug and then I can give you feedback on all of those. em Okay. So I would say for the last minutes, we can uh focus a bit on what's the first steps for you to implement.  So  I would say let's go back to GitHub and create a couple of issues. And then  I would show you

29:28
how I like to go from the issues to branches and pull requests. And then that's the most important point that you create pull requests really early so that you can, when you have a first idea how to do things, ask me via the pull requests if this is what I meant. And that's the goal for today. Then we have kind of the first setup, then you can work on this. And then on Thursday, we can already review what you did. if there are any questions.

29:58
All right, yeah, good stuff. So  yeah, you can go to the issues tab. um And then  we create one issue here, then we create one issue in the board. um Yeah, let's say,  set up Python repository structure.

30:18
or repo structure basically.

30:25
And then you can put below, um if you click there somewhere, like a tasks  list on the top,  on the top right, it's the fifth  element. No, in the, in this um editor box.  Yep. Here.  Then you see there's like bullet points and then further to the right. Right, right, Yep. Task list. Okay. Here you can say add a PI project.

31:00
Enter, use rough.

31:06
for em Linting and  auto formatting  and enter UV for package management.

31:29
Enter and  SRC layout. Do you know the SRC layout source? eh So kind of. Yeah. I mean, there's not too much magic about it, right? The idea is that you create this SRC folder and then inside you create the...  Ah, yes, I do. Yeah. Project name inside the source. Yeah.  And the reason for that is that if you do it like such and you open the folder as a, just as a...

31:58
working directory,  then the imports will not work out of the box. So you cannot just import those folders because they are in the layer below the source folder.  so this forces you to set up the installation of those directories  properly. um Meaning that if you have an Airflow folder, for example, inside that  folder, in order  to import Airflow,  maybe Airflow is not the best.

32:27
name, we would call it airflow  pipelines, for example.  If you want to import airflow pipelines, you need to really install it properly. And this is  good because then you can already locally check if your imports work properly. For example, if you set up a test, you would import that package and then the import would fail if the package wasn't installed correctly. That's why I like this source layout.  Many people actually don't know what's the reason for the source layout.

32:56
and then they have an opinion on it or not, I don't know. But that's at least  what I see about it. um And you can do this with AI as a co-pilot or not, just manually. um But that's the idea to create the first PR as soon as possible, maybe today or tomorrow. Then I can already give you feedback. So um yeah, you can click here on the right to assign yourself.

33:26
And  you can also  for the projects, like let's see if it pops up already. I don't think so. The PDOM project. So click on the sentence or? Yeah, exactly. Yeah, it doesn't pop up. Okay. That's, that's what we do right away afterwards. So  you can scroll down and create this issue.

33:49
I think there should be a green button if you scroll down. Yeah. I need to get another screen. right.  Yeah. Classic.  And you see now this task is like nicely formatted. If you take one of those, then it also counts it somewhere. So it's just nice UI UX. So like this, right? This is the idea of how to create the issues.  And what you can then do based on this is if you go on the right.

34:17
There's in development  under development as a blue text saying create a branch.  Yeah, exactly. And then you can just say create branch. It looks nice. It looks fine.

34:32
This you can skip for now. It's still in the IDE that you can check it out.  So the idea is that you check out this branch locally. em then  maybe you just  add  the PyProjectTermify. can be empty.  You commit it, you push it, and then you create a PR on top of it. Maybe that's something we can just quickly do. If you go to your IDE.

35:01
And you click, oh yeah, it's cloned, right?  If you click on the lower,  ah, you need to CD in the folder, I think. Yeah, CD. And then you can maybe do code space dot. Depending on how it's installed, should open that in the new page. Yeah. And then now you see on the lower left, you see the main branch, meaning that, yeah, it recognized the repo. And if you click on it, you will probably be able to check out the new branch.

35:30
If it doesn't show up like now, you can escape and then command shift P.

35:39
and fetch from all remotes.

35:44
from all remotes here, that's shown. And then now you can say yes, because you want to periodic each fetch. It doesn't perfectly work. So sometimes you still need to say, need to do this fetch from all remotes. But now if you do  a command shift P checkout.

36:03
So you will notice I use this command shift P the command panel a lot.  Not detached, but just two. So you can use your arrows as well to move down and then hit enter. Now you see the origin slash setup branch. You can click on that one. um Yes, exactly. Yeah. Okay. Now it was checked out and now you can just go on the left and uh right click, create file, right? Or click on this button below  above.

36:33
and pyproject.toml

36:39
Enter. You see it got this key icon and kind of understood that this is like a thing.  Exactly.  Git  and just create.  If you go click on the source control, yep, with the one, just say, create PyProjectTimer. And you can also use this magic git commit message thingy. ProjectTimer. Commit. Sync changes. Yep. You can do that.

37:08
It's basically first pulling then pushing. eh And now you can  have you the GitHub PR uh extension. We can check because  you can search for the pull requests  extension and also GitHub.

37:30
Pull requests, install. And also the actions below. You can also do the code spaces. I'm not sure what this is about, but maybe it comes in handy later. I mean, I know what code spaces are. I haven't used the code spaces extension yet. That sounds good. So now you see on the left side, there should be somewhere the PR one. I think it's the one on the bottom. Maybe this one. Yeah, we could have one.

38:00
You can try this. Yes. Pull requests. So you can actually create the pull request from right here, from the IDE. I still go sometimes to get, or I actually many times to GitHub to do the actual PR because somehow my brain based on paths, I like the diff more in GitHub. Sometimes it also doesn't sync perfectly locally. So I don't trust it fully yet. Maybe it has changed in the last months, but yeah, it's anyway, it's nice to create the PR from here. So you can click on this button there.

38:29
with this plus sign. Oh, this one. Yes, this one exactly.  And  then you select as the base, you select main.

38:42
main.  And then create no need for description yet.  Descriptions used to be more important, I would say to give context, but nowadays if you add co-pilot as a reviewer, it will automatically generate a pretty decent description. Okay. So I would just use that maybe copy paste it, change it a little bit. So no need to create it manually in the beginning. Yeah. So

39:11
That's the first PR, right? And then you can assign yourself again. There's this assign yourself button on the assignee. This one here, And you can select me as a reviewer. And the reviewers part. It keeps getting covered all the time. Ah, yeah. Exactly. I am. You need to click on OK as well. It's a bit confusing.

39:41
So just a second. Yeah, it's zoom, right? Yeah, it's gone and covered everything up. I think there's a way to like,  um,  this deactivated, but I always forget. Cause this is,  I don't know why they did this.  Oh.

00:08
Okay. Here we are back. Can you hear me? Yeah. Actually, I had like another bridge, but I think Bob changed it. I mean, I may need to invite you from another mail. Then we don't have the 40 minutes limit. But actually I think maybe it's not bad because if we want to do two times 30 minutes and we get kicked out at 40 minutes, I guess that's our hard cut. eh So,  but maybe we can bring this just home. So.

00:36
Yeah, basically um you create the PR. I will now give a review basically about it.  You see, I get notifications when you assign me to PRs. I think I get even notifications for anything you do in the repo. least  that's how I will set it up. em And yeah, so this is the place where you can now ask questions. So maybe you can share screen again and we could just quickly let you ask one question. Okay, so that should be sharing now.

01:11
Can you see the screen?  I need to...  Yes, I can see it.  One second, I need to just rearrange here. Voila. So, um yeah, let's go to GitHub and ask the question there. It's also possible from the IDE. Maybe we do that another time.  But...

01:35
to know how to do it on GitHub as well.

01:39
Oh, and we wanted to add the issue to the repo to the project. That's also something. Right afterwards. Yeah. You can click here on the PR.

01:51
PR, what is that? Oh, this new pull request. No, sorry. Pull request. mean, create. Okay. Yeah. PR is common lingo for pull request. Sorry. No  worries. No worries. Actually acronyms are not good. uh So always it's better to be explicit, right? Like, What is that? Python explicit is better than implicit. I was just about to say the same  thing. We made actually, we made a YouTube shorts list  about it. Me and Bob.  Have you seen it?

02:21
No, no, I'm not. It was posted on Circle before, but you can also find it on YouTube. We've made like for every Zen, we made a short short where we said some words about it. What our interpretation is. Ah, okay. I'll watch that. Yeah, it's fun. We made it like two years ago or so in near near Bob's place in Spain. Ah, cool. Yeah, I'll watch that. So, yeah, if you scroll up here, then there's a section with changes.

02:51
files changed exactly.  And this is the place where you want to ask questions or let's say where I would like you to ask questions.  Right. Okay. There's not much yet, right? Because it's just one empty file, but it's  the same principle. You see the speech bubble on the right side in the  project file? Yeah. And then you can comment and you say, is this the right place, for example?

03:27
Or maybe rather the right place to create the Pride project, Thommel. And then I can say yes.  I can.

03:43
And then, um yeah, you can see different options, right? Add single comment is really, if you only want to add one comment, that's nice because eh it's quick. You only need to click on that button. That's it. But  most cases you want to do a starter review. So I call it the self review. Okay. Let's say you hack something down in your IDE, right? Yeah. Then before even asking me for a review, em you do a self review. I mean,

04:11
Basically, you could say nowadays you should first just let Co-Pilot make a review and then make your self-review or maybe the other way, you can argue. But it's a good idea to first review the thing yourself and to also let an AI review your code. Okay. Only then ask for a review because assume that the reviewers have no time and they would like to have perfect PRs so that they can just say approve. Never the case, but...

04:39
That's in company context and so on. people will probably not have as much time as they would like to review your work. And oftentimes it's also not so acknowledged by management. Basically, the goal is to achieve your goals. And PRs is always something that you do on the sites, even though PRs can take hours.  anyway, so here you can click on start a review. um And the good thing is with me,

05:04
The one hour is the bottleneck, right? So I surely have that time to give you PR reviews. I use that time.  And  so, yeah, now what you can see is it looks like it's already submitted, but you can see this pending em thing here. Yeah. You need to do is click on the top right there on finish your review. And then you can say, here, can add something. em For example, I like to write  first self review, second self review or whatever.

05:34
You can call it here. Oh, no.  Just you can write uh first  self review em or test review or whatever. Exactly. So this is basically be the first message. And then under this message will be all these comments that you made. You will see it in a second. So if you click here on submit review.

05:56
Now it's actually submitted and that's exactly what I said right now.  It creates this one message, which  was a false simple title, let's say, and then afterwards all the questions. So that's the best way you can ask me questions. Because like this, I directly see the context.  So I see, okay, you asked this question related to this file, related to this line.  You will see when you have actually lines of code, then you can select the lines of code. There will be like plus signs next to them. em

06:26
And so like this,  it's easier for you. mean, you need to know how to ask these questions this way, what we just did, right? But afterwards, when you know it, it's just a couple of clicks. And then you don't need to give me all the context, right? Like as opposed to writing in circle,  hey, I wanted to do this and that file, I did that. What?  Yeah. So get context. Yeah, that's good. So code questions should always be asked in PRs.  OK.

06:54
Okay. That's an opinion on my end that I like to create PRs really early. Yeah.  There is something if you scroll up  in GitHub, which is called draft mode. So I think right now it's not a draft, but if you click on edit of the PR  or you can write draft  column, or maybe it's also by now, it's maybe a premium feature. If you give in the title, you can just start it with em draft.

07:24
So here in this title, yeah? Yeah.  Maybe this works  with Colin as well.

07:33
Call on them and draft.  No, draft and then call in. Sorry. Otherwise it may get an  emoji.  This worked for some time. Maybe it doesn't work anymore if you click on save. um But doesn't seem to work.  There might be also, if you scroll down on the right, there may be something like work in progress. But doesn't seem to be. It could also be that they moved it now into a  premium feature because

08:02
I used to work in our company, for example, we have of course a subscription and they move more and more things into the subscription field. Of course. But what the point that I want to make is usually you can flag it as a draft. Okay. But then reviewers know I don't have to look into this yet. All right. Okay. Got you. understand. Oh, actually no. Oh, see on the reviewer side, like on the right, it says convert to draft.

08:31
So if you click on that, convert to All right, OK. Convert to draft.

08:41
Now it's just labeled that differently. Yeah, that's what I wanted to do. Okay, cool. So  like this, you communicate that, this is still a draft. You don't need to look into it yet. Okay, got you. understand. Yeah. But you can still review it yourself. You can review it with the co-pilot. Yeah. Yeah. You can also, if you have very specific questions to a specific part of the code, you can already ask colleagues um or co-pilot.  So  that's the way I like to work,

09:10
You should check that with your company because some people say, no, you shouldn't create PRs until it's like crystal clean. em And I mean, you can argue maybe if that's the best approach or not, but if it's a company approach, I would maybe first not challenge it, rather do whatever they want to do. And then at some point there may be a space to,  raise those concerns.  But that's for me, like if I work alone, that's how I work because em I always like to set up a system in a way that my brain needs to.

09:40
keep as little information as possible. everything is somehow explicit, right? Now you see, okay, it's a draft.  Maybe you have a description saying like what this is about to do because  it's always good to assume that you are not have time to touch this for three weeks and eh you will forget everything about what the context was.  So the more stuff you put in the context and so on, then the better it is for you have again and for others as well.

10:10
And yeah, yeah, cool.  Cool. So um if we go back to the issues, the goal,  I think we set pretty clear what to do in this first PR, the Python repo structure. Let's create, yeah, let's do like  one more important thing, which is if you go to the project that we add this repository to the  project, the PDM project. em Now it's not showing up, but  it will show up in a second.

10:43
Sorry. And I would create shortcuts for both this repo and for the, for the PDM project. So do want us to go to the Pybyte project? Yes, exactly. This one. then this projects place, projects exactly. And here, PDM David. And best to bookmark this one that you can access it fast. Now what was the process again? I think, can you...

11:14
Can you go back to the repo?  I also spent some time that I did this. No, not here. Here you can run it on.  Settings maybe.

11:24
Maybe it's also something that only I can do, let me see.

11:29
because

11:33
It's just basically convenience that in the projects that we see both the issues  from the PDM repo as well as from your personal repo. Then we have one space where we have all issues. If it's not something that works right away now, it's not a big deal. I will fix it with. um

11:55
with Bob afterwards. Because normally you can add these.

12:02
you

12:14
Yep.

12:23
Yeah, let me take this with me and I will set it up  with Bob afterwards. I don't want to spend the time  now.  Yeah, because then the idea is that in that one Kanban board, um we would have all the things eh that you can do. um And we can just create a couple of small issues now that you get in the habit of it. So if you go to that board, exactly, then you can put into backlog,  add item.

12:51
watch decision app, code clinic series. The decision app.  Yeah. Code clinic series. Those are those links that I sent you, right? Oh, OK. Yeah.  And you can create draft.

13:15
This is now not an issue. It's just like a simple task, I would  say. You can convert it into an issue in the PDM repository. em But you can also just keep it like this. It's maybe easier to see here on the right that says convert to issue. em so that's my suggestion how to use it. uh I just want to show it. then afterwards,  once you know a little bit the different.

13:41
functionalities of the tools, can totally do it the way you like to do. But I like this because then you can put all your tasks that  I may mention in the video or you may have a question or so you can put it here. um And then we can put it into ready and progress and so on.  There's a single point of truth for what you want to work on. And it's also nice because you see here there are some limits on the different parts. So it kind of, you need to...

14:08
It forces you to think about, this really my focus? Should I do this? uh maybe I should work on other things, not so many things in parallel and so on. Okay. Yeah. I think that's it for now. um I will add a little bit more of this knowledge about how to use GitHub, this board sensor and for project management, because I think over the next three weeks, it will make a different difference. Yeah.

14:35
especially when everything gets more more crowded and we have more ideas and so  on. But of course the focus is the coding.  And  yeah, I suggest that next time on Thursday we go directly into the PR. um I mean, if there's something remaining could also be that the first PR, right?  You do know some stuff, you ask me on GitHub, I will review it  asynchronously.  And then maybe on Thursday we just meet and uh merge it and that's it. We can start the next thing.

15:04
Or you get stuck on some things and then we can use the time on Thursday to get you unstuck.  Yes. Questions. Yeah, no problem. Good stuff.  Sounds good. Yeah. Excellent. Cheers Robin.  Yeah. Any questions or how? No, no. The minute it's it's a lot of taking at the minute. So,  yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But no, it's not. mean, it looks, GitHub looks pretty good for managing things. So yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

15:31
And that's something  many people don't actually know about. That's also not too recent, but now two years or three years ago that they put more of these things together.  So if you have a project on your own, you can really do everything in GitHub, which is, I guess, nice.  All right, good stuff. Excellent. Yeah. Then have a nice rest of the day. Have a good morning.  see you on Thursday. OK, see you Thursday. Cheers, Robin. Cheers. Bye-bye.
